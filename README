To install...

For now you'll need ctorrent and a couple of gems.  This assumes you have the ruby, the gem command and macports installed...

git clone git://github.com/justinvt/torrent.git

sudo port install ctorrent
sudo gem install mechanize
sudo gem install hpricot

cd trrnt
sudo chmod +x trrnt.rb
sudo mv trrnt.rb /usr/local/bin/trrnt (or something like that to make it an executable wherever you'd like)





Usage...

sudo trrnt cloverfield

or

sudo trrnt "teenage mutant ninja turtles"

Search isohunt (for now) for whatever is in the quotes.  You won't need quotes for single word searches.  It will take the fittest result (first result with isohunt), download the torrent file and then get to work on he movie.  Ctorrent's default interface is a little shitty, so to get more info you can do stuff like...
